# First Aimbot

This is an aimbot I created for the game assault cube so I could learn how cheats for video games are made.

## Things I could have added

- Checking to see if a target is behind a wall.

- Using distance as a factor for choosing who to aim at.
    - the closer people are to you the easier it is for them to aim at you. 

- Automatically detecting how many entities there are rather than asking for that information from the user.
